# Risk Assessment & Mitigation

## Technical Risks

```yaml
Risk: Analysis Performance Degradation
Impact: High
Probability: Medium
Mitigation:
  - Comprehensive performance testing
  - Resource monitoring and alerting
  - Graceful degradation mechanisms
  - Caching optimization

Risk: Container Security Vulnerabilities
Impact: High
Probability: Low
Mitigation:
  - Regular security scanning
  - Minimal base images
  - Security policy enforcement
  - Incident response procedures

Risk: Scalability Bottlenecks
Impact: Medium
Probability: Medium
Mitigation:
  - Horizontal scaling design
  - Load testing and capacity planning
  - Database optimization
  - CDN implementation
```

## Operational Risks

```yaml
Risk: Dependency Supply Chain Attacks
Impact: High
Probability: Medium
