# Story 2.1: JavaScript/TypeScript AST Parsing Engine

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer analyzing an unknown codebase,  
**I want** the system to parse and understand JavaScript and TypeScript source code structure,  
**so that** I can get insights into functions, classes, modules, and code organization patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. AST parsing engine processes JavaScript (.js, .jsx) and TypeScript (.ts, .tsx) files accurately
2. Code structure analysis identifies functions, classes, interfaces, variables, and export/import statements
3. Module relationship mapping tracks dependencies between source files and external packages
4. Syntax error handling provides graceful degradation for malformed or incomplete code files
5. Performance optimization enables parsing of repositories with 10,000+ source files within time limits
6. Memory management prevents parser from consuming excessive resources during large repository analysis
7. Parser output structured in standardized format suitable for downstream analysis and documentation generation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

-   Story 1.3 established comprehensive container security framework with 2GB memory limits and resource monitoring that will constrain AST parser execution
-   Existing audit logging system in `pkg/logger/` provides structured logging capabilities for AST parsing operations
-   Container isolation in `internal/security/sandbox/` ensures secure execution environment for potentially untrusted code analysis
-   Resource cleanup orchestration patterns from Story 1.3 can be applied to AST parsing cleanup and memory management

### Architecture Context and Technical Specifications

**AST Parser Component Architecture** [Source: architecture/detailed-component-architecture.md#ast-parser]:

```python
class ASTAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.languages = ['javascript', 'typescript', 'tsx', 'jsx']
        self.parsers = self._initialize_parsers()

    def parse_codebase(self, repo_path: str) -> AnalysisResult:
        # Multi-threaded parsing with tree-sitter
        # Extract: functions, classes, imports, exports
        # Generate: call graphs, dependency maps
```

**Technology Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md#analysis-engine]:

-   **AST Parsing**: tree-sitter (multi-language support) for accurate JavaScript/TypeScript parsing
-   **Language**: Go (orchestration) + Python (ML/AI) for analysis processing
-   **Performance**: Parallel processing with bounded goroutines for concurrent file parsing
-   **Security**: Integration with existing security sandbox for safe code analysis

**Analysis Pipeline Integration** [Source: architecture/data-flow-architecture.md#analysis-pipeline]:

The AST Parser operates within the Parallel Analysis Phase alongside Dependency Analysis and Security Scanning:

-   Input: Repository path from secure container
-   Processing: Multi-threaded AST parsing extracting functions, classes, imports, exports
-   Output: Structured AST data for Results Aggregation phase
-   Integration: Feeds into Documentation Generation for component mapping

**Core Analysis Result Schema** [Source: architecture/data-flow-architecture.md#core-analysis-result]:

```json
{
    "code_analysis": {
        "ast_data": "object", // AST parser primary output
        "component_map": "object", // Generated from AST analysis
        "complexity_metrics": "object", // Derived from AST structure
        "quality_score": "number" // Calculated from AST metrics
    }
}
```

**Performance Requirements** [Source: architecture/detailed-component-architecture.md#security-sandbox-architecture]:

-   **Memory**: 2GB hard limit enforced by container security
-   **CPU**: 4 cores maximum allocation for parallel processing
-   **Time**: 1-hour execution limit for complete repository analysis
-   **Scale**: Must handle 10,000+ source files within resource constraints
