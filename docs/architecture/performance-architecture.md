# Performance Architecture

## Performance Requirements & Targets

```yaml
Analysis Performance:
    - Target: Complete analysis within 1 hour
    - Repository Size: Up to 10GB
    - Concurrent Analyses: 100 (cloud deployment)
    - Resource per Analysis: 2GB RAM, 4 CPU cores

Optimization Strategies:
    - Parallel processing of analysis components
    - Streaming processing for large files
    - Intelligent caching of common dependencies
    - Progressive results reporting
```

## Caching Strategy

```yaml
Multi-Level Caching:
    L1 - Memory Cache:
        - AST parsing results for common patterns
        - Dependency resolution cache
        - Template rendering cache

    L2 - Local Disk Cache:
        - Vulnerability database snapshots
        - Parsed dependency trees
        - Generated documentation templates

    L3 - Distributed Cache (Redis):
        - Cross-session result sharing
        - Common repository analysis results
        - User-specific configuration cache

Cache Invalidation:
    - Time-based: Vulnerability data (24 hours)
    - Version-based: Dependency analysis (semantic versioning)
    - Manual: User-triggered cache clearing
```
