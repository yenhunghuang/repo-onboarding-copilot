# Story 1.2: Secure Repository Ingestion

## Status

âœ… **COMPLETED** - All tasks implemented and tested successfully

## Story

**As a** security-conscious developer,  
**I want** repositories to be cloned and isolated in secure sandbox environments,  
**so that** untrusted code cannot access my system or network resources.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Git repositories cloned into isolated temporary directories with restricted permissions
2. Docker containers created with resource limits (2GB RAM, 4 CPU cores) and network isolation
3. Repository size validation prevents analysis of repositories exceeding 10GB limit
4. Clone operations timeout after reasonable duration to prevent hanging processes
5. Comprehensive audit logging captures all repository access and clone operations
6. Failed clone operations provide clear diagnostic information without exposing sensitive data
7. Automatic cleanup removes temporary files and containers after analysis completion or failure

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

-   Story 1.1 established excellent security foundations with comprehensive URL validation using a dedicated security package at `pkg/validator/`
-   Existing structured logging system in `pkg/logger/` provides JSON-formatted output with appropriate log levels
-   Configuration management system in `pkg/config/` supports environment-specific YAML configs
-   Clean Go architecture established with proper error handling patterns using wrapped errors

### Architecture Context and Technical Specifications

**Container Security Model** [Source: architecture/detailed-component-architecture.md#3-security-sandbox-architecture]:

-   Base Image: scratch or distroless for minimal attack surface
-   User: Non-root user execution with minimal privileges
-   Filesystem: Read-only with tmpfs for temporary files
-   Network: Isolated network namespace with no external access
-   Resource Limits: Memory 2GB hard limit, CPU 4 cores maximum, 10GB temporary disk space, 1-hour execution limit
-   Security Controls: Seccomp profiles blocking dangerous syscalls, AppArmor/SELinux policies for additional restrictions

**Git Handler Implementation** [Source: architecture/detailed-component-architecture.md#git-handler]:

```go
type GitHandler struct {
    CloneTimeout    time.Duration
    MaxRepoSize     int64
    TempDir         string
    AuditLogger     *AuditLogger
}
```

**Defense in Depth Security Strategy** [Source: architecture/security-architecture.md#defense-in-depth-strategy]:

-   Layer 3 - Container Security: Minimal base images (distroless/scratch), non-root user execution, read-only filesystems, resource limits and quotas
-   Layer 4 - Runtime Security: Seccomp and AppArmor profiles, capability dropping, namespace isolation, runtime monitoring and alerting

**Threat Mitigations** [Source: architecture/security-architecture.md#threat-model-mitigations]:

-   Malicious Repository Code Execution: Static analysis only (no code execution), container isolation with network restrictions, resource limits and timeouts, monitoring and alerting
-   Container Escape: Latest container runtime with security patches, user namespace isolation, seccomp and AppArmor restrictions, regular security scanning
-   Data Exfiltration: Network isolation during analysis, audit logging of all operations, temporary storage with automatic cleanup

**Project Structure Alignment** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#project-structure]:

-   Git operations: `internal/security/sandbox/` for container isolation management
-   Security validation: `internal/security/validator/` for input validation and sanitization
-   Audit logging: `pkg/logger/` for structured logging (already established in Story 1.1)
-   Configuration: `pkg/config/` for security parameters (already established in Story 1.1)
-   Testing: `test/integration/security/` for security-focused integration tests

**Technology Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md#infrastructure-deployment]:

-   Containerization: Docker with multi-stage builds
-   Base Image: Alpine Linux (security-focused) or distroless
-   Security: User namespaces, cgroups, seccomp profiles
-   Networking: Isolated networks with egress control
-   Resources: Memory and CPU limits enforced with monitoring

### Data Flow Integration
