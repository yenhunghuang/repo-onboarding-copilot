# Repo Onboarding Copilot Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Transform unknown codebases into comprehensive onboarding experiences within 1 hour
• Reduce developer onboarding time from weeks to hours, saving $15K-$30K per developer
• Enable safe analysis of untrusted repositories through automated security sandboxing
• Generate executable outputs (working scripts, tests, runbooks) not just static documentation
• Establish foundation for $45M addressable market in automated developer onboarding solutions
• Achieve >90% successful repository analysis across target languages
• Deliver MVP within 6-month timeline for customer validation and Series A positioning

### Background Context

The software development industry faces a critical productivity bottleneck: developers spend 2-4 weeks understanding new codebases before making productive contributions. This knowledge transfer problem costs organizations $15K-$30K per developer and creates significant barriers to team scaling, project transitions, and open source adoption. Current solutions like GitHub Insights, SonarQube, and Sourcegraph provide fragmented capabilities but lack comprehensive automation and end-to-end onboarding workflows.

The Repo Onboarding Copilot addresses this market gap through intelligent automation that transforms any Git repository into a complete onboarding experience. By combining security-first analysis, multi-language support, and executable output generation, the solution positions to capture significant value in the $450M serviceable market for code analysis tools, with particular focus on the emerging $45M automated onboarding segment.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The Repo Onboarding Copilot prioritizes developer efficiency through CLI-first automation with future web visualization capabilities. The primary experience centers on command-line simplicity: developers input repository URLs and receive comprehensive, navigable documentation packages. The interface philosophy emphasizes "invisible automation with transparent results" - complex analysis happens behind secure sandboxing while users receive clear, actionable outputs formatted for immediate developer consumption.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **CLI-First Workflow**: Primary interaction through terminal commands with intuitive syntax (`onboard-repo https://github.com/user/repo`)
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Analysis results presented in layered complexity - executive summary first, detailed technical analysis accessible through navigation
- **Context-Aware Navigation**: Generated documentation includes smart cross-references and dependency linking for intuitive codebase exploration
- **Real-time Feedback**: Progress indicators during analysis with clear status updates and estimated completion times
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful failure handling with diagnostic information and retry mechanisms

### Core Screens and Views

1. **CLI Terminal Interface** - Primary command execution environment with progress feedback
2. **Generated Architecture Dashboard** - Visual system overview with interactive component mapping (HTML export)
3. **Dependency Analysis View** - Interactive dependency tree with vulnerability highlighting
4. **Executable Runbook Pages** - Step-by-step setup guides with copy-paste command blocks
5. **Learning Roadmap Interface** - Progressive skill development timeline with milestone tracking
6. **Risk Assessment Report** - Security and maintainability analysis with prioritized action items
7. **Validation Suite Dashboard** - Test execution status and health check results

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

All generated documentation and future web interfaces must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure accessibility for developers with disabilities. This includes proper heading structure, color contrast compliance, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility for all analysis outputs.

### Branding

Clean, technical aesthetic reflecting developer tool sophistication with focus on readability and information density. Visual design should emphasize trust and security given the sensitive nature of codebase analysis. Color palette should support syntax highlighting and code visualization while maintaining professional appearance suitable for enterprise environments.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

CLI tool targets all major development environments (macOS, Linux, Windows). Generated documentation optimized for desktop development workflows with responsive design supporting tablet review and mobile reference access. Future web application will prioritize desktop-first design with responsive scaling for cross-device collaboration.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing CLI tool, analysis engine, and output generation components. This approach simplifies MVP development, testing, and deployment while enabling shared utilities and consistent versioning across components. Future scaling may require polyrepo transition for microservices architecture.

### Service Architecture

**Monolith with Modular Design** - MVP implementation uses single deployable application with clearly separated modules: Git Interface, Security Sandbox, Analysis Engine, and Output Generator. This approach minimizes operational complexity while establishing clean architectural boundaries for future microservices extraction. Container-based isolation provides security without distributed system complexity.

### Testing Requirements

**Full Testing Pyramid** - Comprehensive testing strategy including:
- Unit tests for analysis algorithms and output generation (>90% coverage)
- Integration tests for Git operations and sandbox isolation
- End-to-end tests validating complete repository analysis workflows
- Security testing for sandbox containment and vulnerability detection
- Performance testing to validate 1-hour analysis targets
- Manual testing convenience methods for rapid developer feedback during iteration

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Core Analysis Engine**: Go for performance-critical Git operations and file system traversal, with Rust consideration for security-sensitive parsing components
- **AI/ML Components**: Python with established AST parsing libraries (ast, tree-sitter) and security analysis frameworks
- **CLI Interface**: Go for cross-platform compatibility and single-binary distribution
- **Container Management**: Docker for sandbox isolation with Kubernetes readiness for cloud scaling

**Security Architecture:**
- **Sandbox Technology**: Docker containers with resource limits, network isolation, and read-only file system mounts
- **Code Analysis Strategy**: Static analysis only for MVP - no code execution within analyzed repositories
- **Audit Requirements**: Comprehensive logging of all repository access, analysis operations, and output generation
- **Threat Model**: Assume all analyzed repositories are potentially malicious with defense-in-depth approach

**Development Infrastructure:**
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated testing, security scanning, and release management
- **Dependency Management**: Go modules with vulnerability scanning integration
- **Development Environment**: Docker Compose for consistent local development with sandbox testing
- **Version Control**: Semantic versioning with automated changelog generation

**Performance and Scalability:**
- **Resource Constraints**: 2GB RAM, 4 CPU cores per analysis session with automatic cleanup
- **Concurrency Model**: Bounded parallelism for repository analysis with queue management
- **Caching Strategy**: Aggressive caching of dependency analysis and vulnerability data
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics for analysis performance and resource utilization

**Data Management:**
- **Storage Requirements**: Ephemeral analysis storage with optional result persistence
- **Output Formats**: Structured Markdown with HTML export capability for web viewing
- **Configuration**: YAML-based configuration with environment variable overrides
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logging with configurable verbosity levels
