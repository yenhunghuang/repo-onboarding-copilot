# Coding Standards

## Go Development Standards

```yaml
Code Organization:
  Package Structure:
    - Domain-driven package organization
    - Clear separation of concerns (handlers, services, repositories)
    - Minimal cyclic dependencies
    - Public interfaces for testability
  
  Naming Conventions:
    - PascalCase for exported functions/types
    - camelCase for unexported functions/variables
    - Descriptive names over abbreviated ones
    - Interface names ending with -er when appropriate
  
  Error Handling:
    - Always handle errors explicitly
    - Use wrapped errors with context (fmt.Errorf with %w verb)
    - Custom error types for domain-specific errors
    - Structured logging for error context

Code Quality:
  Testing:
    - Unit test coverage minimum 80%
    - Table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
    - Test doubles (mocks/stubs) for external dependencies
    - Integration tests for critical paths
  
  Documentation:
    - Package-level documentation for all public packages
    - Function documentation for exported functions
    - Code comments for complex business logic
    - README files for package usage examples
  
  Performance:
    - Avoid premature optimization
    - Profile before optimizing
    - Use appropriate data structures
    - Minimize allocations in hot paths
```

## Security Standards

```yaml
Input Validation:
  - Validate all external inputs
  - Use type-safe parsing
  - Implement input sanitization
  - Set appropriate limits on input size

Authentication & Authorization:
  - JWT tokens with secure signing
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Principle of least privilege
  - Secure session management

Data Protection:
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
  - Use TLS for data in transit
  - Implement proper key management
  - Regular security audits

Container Security:
  - Non-root user execution
  - Minimal base images
  - Regular image updates
  - Resource limits enforcement
```

## Development Workflow

```yaml
Version Control:
  - Git flow with feature branches
  - Descriptive commit messages
  - Pull request reviews required
  - Automated testing on all branches

Code Review:
  - Mandatory peer review for all changes
  - Focus on security, performance, and maintainability
  - Architectural alignment verification
  - Documentation completeness check

Continuous Integration:
  - Automated testing pipeline
  - Code quality gates (linting, formatting)
  - Security scanning (gosec, trivy)
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning
```
