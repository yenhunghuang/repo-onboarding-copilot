# Development & Testing Strategy

## Development Workflow

```yaml
Branching Strategy:
    - main: Production-ready code
    - develop: Integration branch
    - feature/*: Feature development
    - hotfix/*: Critical fixes

CI/CD Pipeline: 1. Code commit triggers automated tests
    2. Security scanning (SAST/DAST)
    3. Dependency vulnerability checks
    4. Integration tests with containerized environment
    5. Performance benchmarking
    6. Documentation generation
    7. Automated deployment to staging
    8. Manual approval for production
```

## Testing Strategy

```yaml
Testing Pyramid:
    Unit Tests (70%):
        - Go: testify framework
        - Python: pytest
        - Coverage target: >90

    Integration Tests (20%):
        - Docker-based test environments
        - Database integration tests
        - External service mocking

    End-to-End Tests (10%):
        - CLI workflow testing
        - Performance benchmarking
        - Security validation
        - Real repository analysis
```

## Quality Gates

```yaml
Code Quality:
    - Static analysis (golangci-lint, black)
    - Dependency vulnerability scanning
    - License compliance checking
    - Documentation coverage validation

Performance:
    - Benchmark regression testing
    - Memory leak detection
    - Resource utilization monitoring
    - Analysis duration tracking

Security:
    - Container image scanning
    - Secrets detection
    - Security policy validation
    - Penetration testing (quarterly)
```
