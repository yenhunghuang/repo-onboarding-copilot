# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The Repo Onboarding Copilot prioritizes developer efficiency through CLI-first automation with future web visualization capabilities. The primary experience centers on command-line simplicity: developers input repository URLs and receive comprehensive, navigable documentation packages. The interface philosophy emphasizes "invisible automation with transparent results" - complex analysis happens behind secure sandboxing while users receive clear, actionable outputs formatted for immediate developer consumption.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **CLI-First Workflow**: Primary interaction through terminal commands with intuitive syntax (`onboard-repo https://github.com/user/repo`)
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Analysis results presented in layered complexity - executive summary first, detailed technical analysis accessible through navigation
- **Context-Aware Navigation**: Generated documentation includes smart cross-references and dependency linking for intuitive codebase exploration
- **Real-time Feedback**: Progress indicators during analysis with clear status updates and estimated completion times
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful failure handling with diagnostic information and retry mechanisms

## Core Screens and Views

1. **CLI Terminal Interface** - Primary command execution environment with progress feedback
2. **Generated Architecture Dashboard** - Visual system overview with interactive component mapping (HTML export)
3. **Dependency Analysis View** - Interactive dependency tree with vulnerability highlighting
4. **Executable Runbook Pages** - Step-by-step setup guides with copy-paste command blocks
5. **Learning Roadmap Interface** - Progressive skill development timeline with milestone tracking
6. **Risk Assessment Report** - Security and maintainability analysis with prioritized action items
7. **Validation Suite Dashboard** - Test execution status and health check results

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

All generated documentation and future web interfaces must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure accessibility for developers with disabilities. This includes proper heading structure, color contrast compliance, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility for all analysis outputs.

## Branding

Clean, technical aesthetic reflecting developer tool sophistication with focus on readability and information density. Visual design should emphasize trust and security given the sensitive nature of codebase analysis. Color palette should support syntax highlighting and code visualization while maintaining professional appearance suitable for enterprise environments.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

CLI tool targets all major development environments (macOS, Linux, Windows). Generated documentation optimized for desktop development workflows with responsive design supporting tablet review and mobile reference access. Future web application will prioritize desktop-first design with responsive scaling for cross-device collaboration.
