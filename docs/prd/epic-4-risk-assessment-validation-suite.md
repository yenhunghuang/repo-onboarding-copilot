# Epic 4: Risk Assessment & Validation Suite

**Expanded Goal:** Implement advanced security vulnerability detection, performance analysis, and automated testing suite generation with comprehensive quality gates and validation reporting. This epic delivers the enterprise-grade analysis capabilities that justify competitive differentiation and enterprise adoption by providing actionable insights into security risks, performance bottlenecks, and quality assurance gaps.

## Story 4.1: Security Vulnerability Detection and Risk Assessment

As a **security-conscious developer**,
I want **comprehensive security analysis identifying vulnerabilities, risks, and compliance gaps**,
so that **I can prioritize security improvements and ensure safe deployment practices**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Static security analysis scans JavaScript/TypeScript code for common vulnerabilities (XSS, injection, auth bypass)
2. Dependency vulnerability assessment integrates with CVE databases for real-time threat identification
3. Security configuration review identifies insecure settings in package.json, environment files, and framework configurations
4. Data flow analysis tracks sensitive information handling and identifies potential exposure points
5. Compliance checking validates adherence to security best practices (OWASP Top 10, framework-specific guidelines)
6. Risk scoring system prioritizes vulnerabilities by severity, exploitability, and business impact
7. Remediation guidance provides specific steps and code examples for vulnerability resolution

## Story 4.2: Performance Analysis and Optimization Recommendations

As a **performance-conscious developer**,
I want **automated detection of performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities**,
so that **I can improve application speed and user experience before issues impact production**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Bundle size analysis identifies large dependencies and suggests optimization strategies for faster loading
2. Code performance scanning detects inefficient algorithms, memory leaks, and resource-intensive operations
3. Asset optimization review identifies unoptimized images, fonts, and other static resources affecting load times
4. Database query analysis examines ORM usage and SQL patterns for potential performance improvements
5. Caching opportunity identification suggests where caching could improve response times and reduce server load
6. Performance budget recommendations establish metrics and thresholds for ongoing performance monitoring
7. Optimization roadmap prioritizes performance improvements by impact versus implementation effort

## Story 4.3: Automated Testing Suite Generation

As a **quality assurance engineer**,
I want **automated generation of test scaffolding and validation suites based on code analysis**,
so that **I can quickly establish comprehensive testing coverage for unfamiliar codebases**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Unit test scaffolding generated for functions and classes with basic assertion templates
2. Integration test identification suggests critical workflow paths requiring end-to-end validation
3. Test data generation creates realistic mock data based on detected data models and API schemas
4. Coverage gap analysis identifies untested code paths and suggests prioritized testing strategies
5. Testing framework recommendations align with existing project patterns and team preferences
6. Smoke test suite creation provides basic health checks for critical application functionality
7. Testing documentation includes best practices and examples specific to detected technology stack

## Story 4.4: Quality Gates and Validation Reporting

As a **technical lead**,
I want **comprehensive quality assessment with actionable improvement recommendations**,
so that **I can make informed decisions about code quality, technical debt, and development priorities**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Quality metrics dashboard aggregates security, performance, and maintainability scores with trend analysis
2. Technical debt assessment quantifies improvement effort required and prioritizes remediation activities
3. Code review checklist generation provides team-specific guidelines based on detected patterns and risks
4. Deployment readiness assessment evaluates production suitability with go/no-go recommendations
5. Improvement roadmap creation sequences quality enhancements by impact, effort, and dependencies
6. Team capability assessment identifies skill gaps and training needs based on technology stack complexity
7. Executive summary reporting provides high-level insights suitable for stakeholder communication and decision-making
