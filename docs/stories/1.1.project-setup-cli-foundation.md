```

### Input Validation Requirements

Critical security requirements for URL validation [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#security-standards]:

-   Validate all external inputs
-   Use type-safe parsing
-   Implement input sanitization
-   Set appropriate limits on input size

### Error Handling Standards

Must follow Go error handling standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#go-development-standards]:

-   Always handle errors explicitly
-   Use wrapped errors with context (fmt.Errorf with %w verb)
-   Custom error types for domain-specific errors
-   Structured logging for error context

### Package Design Principles

Follow clean architecture principles [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#key-design-principles]:

-   Domain-driven design with clear bounded contexts
-   Internal packages for implementation details
-   Public packages (pkg/) for reusable components
-   Import restrictions: internal packages cannot import cmd/
-   Interface-based design for testability

## Testing

### Testing Standards

**Coverage Target**: Unit test coverage minimum 80% [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#code-quality]

**Testing Framework**: Go standard testing with testify framework [Source: architecture/development-testing-strategy.md#testing-strategy]

**Test Types Required**:

-   Unit Tests (70%): Table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
-   Integration Tests (20%): CLI workflow testing
-   End-to-End Tests (10%): Real command execution testing
    [Source: architecture/development-testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]

**Test File Organization**:

-   Test files should follow \_test.go naming convention
-   Place unit tests alongside source files
-   Integration tests in test/integration/ directory
-   Use test doubles (mocks/stubs) for external dependencies
    [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#code-quality]

**Quality Gates**:

-   Static analysis (golangci-lint)
-   Dependency vulnerability scanning
-   Documentation coverage validation
    [Source: architecture/development-testing-strategy.md#quality-gates]

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-20

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent foundation implementation** with professional-grade architecture following clean code principles. The implementation demonstrates senior-level understanding of Go best practices, security-first design, and comprehensive testing strategies. All acceptance criteria have been met with exceptional quality standards.

**Architecture Strengths:**
- Clean separation between packages following domain-driven design
- Proper use of internal/ vs pkg/ package structure 
- Interface-based design enabling testability
- Security-first approach with comprehensive input validation
- Structured error handling with context preservation

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `pkg/utils/utils.go`
  - **Change**: Removed incomplete `SanitizeURL()` function and replaced with `TrimWhitespace()`
  - **Why**: Original function contained only a TODO comment and basic whitespace trimming, creating security confusion since proper sanitization exists in validator package
  - **How**: Eliminates potential security gaps, removes code duplication, and provides clear single-purpose utility function

- **File**: `pkg/utils/utils_test.go` 
  - **Change**: Updated test function name and calls to match refactored `TrimWhitespace()` function
  - **Why**: Maintains test coverage and consistency after function rename
  - **How**: Ensures all tests remain valid and properly test the refactored functionality

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent adherence to Go standards with proper error wrapping, structured logging, and clean architecture
