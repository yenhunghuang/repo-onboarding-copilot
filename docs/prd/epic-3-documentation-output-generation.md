# Epic 3: Documentation & Output Generation

**Expanded Goal:** Create the comprehensive documentation generation system that transforms analysis results into actionable onboarding materials. This epic delivers the core customer value proposition by producing executable runbooks, visual architecture maps, and progressive learning roadmaps that enable developers to quickly understand and contribute to unknown codebases within the 1-hour target timeframe.

## Story 3.1: Executable Runbook Generation

As a **new developer joining a project**,
I want **step-by-step setup and launch instructions generated automatically from repository analysis**,
so that **I can get the application running locally without hunting through documentation or asking teammates**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Environment setup instructions generated based on detected package managers, runtime versions, and configuration files
2. Dependency installation commands extracted from package.json scripts and lock files with proper sequencing
3. Database setup and migration instructions identified from configuration files and schema definitions
4. Application launch procedures generated with environment variable requirements and port configurations
5. Common troubleshooting scenarios anticipated with solutions based on detected technology stack patterns
6. Copy-paste command blocks formatted for easy terminal execution with proper error handling
7. Setup validation checklist generated to confirm successful environment configuration

## Story 3.2: Interactive Architecture Visualization

As a **software architect or technical lead**,
I want **visual representations of system architecture with interactive navigation capabilities**,
so that **I can quickly understand component relationships and identify key integration points**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. System architecture diagrams generated showing high-level component organization and data flow
2. Interactive dependency graphs enable drill-down exploration from system overview to file-level details
3. Component relationship maps highlight critical paths, bottlenecks, and integration boundaries
4. Technology stack visualization shows frameworks, libraries, and external service dependencies
5. Export capabilities provide diagrams in multiple formats (SVG, PNG, HTML) for documentation and presentations
6. Responsive design ensures diagram readability across desktop and mobile viewing environments
7. Navigation controls enable zooming, filtering, and layer management for complex architecture exploration

## Story 3.3: Progressive Learning Roadmap Creation

As a **developer new to a codebase**,
I want **a structured learning path with 30-60-90 day milestones**,
so that **I can systematically build understanding and identify when I'm ready for different types of contributions**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. 30-day roadmap focuses on environment setup, core concepts, and basic navigation with beginner-friendly tasks
2. 60-day roadmap includes component understanding, common workflows, and guided code reading exercises
3. 90-day roadmap covers advanced patterns, architecture decisions, and independent contribution readiness
4. Skill assessment checkpoints validate understanding at each milestone with practical exercises
5. Resource recommendations include relevant documentation, tutorials, and code examples based on detected technologies
6. Contribution suggestions identify good first issues, documentation improvements, and low-risk enhancement opportunities
7. Progress tracking mechanisms enable developers to mark completed milestones and unlock advanced content

## Story 3.4: Comprehensive Documentation Package Assembly

As a **development team**,
I want **all analysis results and generated documentation packaged in a navigable, shareable format**,
so that **the entire team can benefit from automated onboarding insights and refer to them over time**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Markdown documentation generated with consistent formatting, cross-references, and navigation structure
2. HTML export provides interactive browsing experience with search, filtering, and responsive design
3. PDF generation creates printable reference materials suitable for offline review and team distribution
4. Documentation index organizes content by relevance with quick access to most critical onboarding information
5. Metadata inclusion provides analysis timestamp, repository version, and generated content provenance
6. Integration instructions explain how to incorporate generated documentation into existing team workflows
7. Update mechanisms enable regeneration of documentation as repository evolves over time
