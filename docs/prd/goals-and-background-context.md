# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
• Transform unknown codebases into comprehensive onboarding experiences within 1 hour
• Reduce developer onboarding time from weeks to hours, saving $15K-$30K per developer
• Enable safe analysis of untrusted repositories through automated security sandboxing
• Generate executable outputs (working scripts, tests, runbooks) not just static documentation
• Establish foundation for $45M addressable market in automated developer onboarding solutions
• Achieve >90% successful repository analysis across target languages
• Deliver MVP within 6-month timeline for customer validation and Series A positioning

## Background Context

The software development industry faces a critical productivity bottleneck: developers spend 2-4 weeks understanding new codebases before making productive contributions. This knowledge transfer problem costs organizations $15K-$30K per developer and creates significant barriers to team scaling, project transitions, and open source adoption. Current solutions like GitHub Insights, SonarQube, and Sourcegraph provide fragmented capabilities but lack comprehensive automation and end-to-end onboarding workflows.

The Repo Onboarding Copilot addresses this market gap through intelligent automation that transforms any Git repository into a complete onboarding experience. By combining security-first analysis, multi-language support, and executable output generation, the solution positions to capture significant value in the $450M serviceable market for code analysis tools, with particular focus on the emerging $45M automated onboarding segment.
