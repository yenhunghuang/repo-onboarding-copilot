# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The system shall accept Git repository URLs as input and clone repositories into secure analysis environments

**FR2:** The system shall perform static code analysis on JavaScript and TypeScript files using AST parsing without code execution

**FR3:** The system shall generate visual architecture maps showing component relationships and system structure

**FR4:** The system shall create complete dependency trees with vulnerability assessment for all project dependencies

**FR5:** The system shall produce executable runbooks with step-by-step setup, build, and launch instructions

**FR6:** The system shall identify and document security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and maintainability risks

**FR7:** The system shall generate 30-60-90 day learning roadmaps with progressive skill development milestones

**FR8:** The system shall create automated validation suites including smoke tests and health checks

**FR9:** The system shall complete full repository analysis and documentation generation within 1 hour

**NFR6:** The system shall scale to process 100 concurrent repository analyses on cloud infrastructure

**NFR7:** All generated documentation shall maintain readability scores appropriate for junior developer comprehension

**NFR8:** The system shall provide audit logs for all repository access and analysis operations

**NFR9:** Recovery mechanisms shall enable graceful handling of analysis failures with diagnostic reporting

**NFR10:** The system shall maintain backward compatibility for generated outputs across version updates
