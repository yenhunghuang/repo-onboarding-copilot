# Security Architecture

## Defense in Depth Strategy

```yaml
Layer 1 - Network Security:
    - Input validation and sanitization
    - Rate limiting and DDoS protection
    - TLS encryption for all communications
    - Network segmentation for analysis containers

Layer 2 - Application Security:
    - Authentication and authorization
    - Input validation and output encoding
    - Secure coding practices
    - Dependency vulnerability scanning

Layer 3 - Container Security:
    - Minimal base images (distroless/scratch)
    - Non-root user execution
    - Read-only filesystems
    - Resource limits and quotas

Layer 4 - Runtime Security:
    - Seccomp and AppArmor profiles
    - Capability dropping
    - Namespace isolation
    - Runtime monitoring and alerting
```

## Threat Model & Mitigations

```yaml
Threat: Malicious Repository Code Execution
Mitigation:
  - Static analysis only (no code execution)
  - Container isolation with network restrictions
  - Resource limits and timeouts
  - Monitoring and alerting

Threat: Container Escape
Mitigation:
  - Latest container runtime with security patches
  - User namespace isolation
  - Seccomp and AppArmor restrictions
  - Regular security scanning

Threat: Data Exfiltration
Mitigation:
  - Network isolation during analysis
  - Audit logging of all operations
  - Temporary storage with automatic cleanup
  - Encrypted data at rest and in transit

Threat: Denial of Service
Mitigation:
  - Resource limits per analysis
  - Queue management with prioritization
  - Rate limiting and throttling
  - Auto-scaling capabilities
```
