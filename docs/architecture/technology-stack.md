    State Management: Zustand or React Query
```

## Backend & Core Services

```yaml
Application Core:
    Language: Go 1.21+
    Architecture: Modular monolith with clean interfaces
    Concurrency: Goroutines with worker pools

API Gateway (Future):
    Framework: Gin or Fiber (Go)
    Authentication: JWT with refresh tokens
    Rate Limiting: Token bucket algorithm
    Monitoring: Prometheus metrics

Analysis Engine:
    Language: Go (orchestration) + Python (ML/AI)
    AST Parsing: tree-sitter (multi-language support)
    Security: Semgrep, gosec integration
    Performance: Parallel processing with bounded goroutines
```

## Data & Storage

```yaml
Primary Storage:
    Database: SQLite (embedded) for MVP, PostgreSQL for cloud
    Cache: Redis for distributed caching
    Files: Local filesystem with S3 backup option

Analysis Data:
    Format: JSON for structured data, MessagePack for performance
    Compression: gzip for storage optimization
    Indexes: B-tree indexes on analysis metadata

Vulnerability Data:
    Source: NVD, OWASP, GitHub Advisory
    Updates: Daily automated feeds
    Storage: Embedded database with full-text search
```

## Infrastructure & Deployment

```yaml
Containerization:
    Runtime: Docker with multi-stage builds
    Base Image: Alpine Linux (security-focused)
    Orchestration: Docker Compose (local), Kubernetes (cloud)

Security:
    Isolation: User namespaces, cgroups, seccomp
    Networking: Isolated networks with egress control
    Resources: Memory and CPU limits enforced

Monitoring:
    Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana
    Logging: Structured JSON with ELK stack
    Tracing: OpenTelemetry (cloud deployment)
    Health Checks: HTTP endpoints with readiness probes
```
