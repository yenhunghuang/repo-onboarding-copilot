# Epic 1: Foundation & Security Infrastructure

**Expanded Goal:** Establish the secure project foundation with Git repository ingestion capabilities and container-based analysis sandbox. This epic delivers the fundamental security and operational infrastructure required for safe analysis of untrusted code repositories, while providing an initial CLI interface for developer interaction and basic repository validation capabilities.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and CLI Foundation

As a **developer**,
I want **a command-line tool that can accept repository URLs and initialize the analysis environment**,
so that **I have a secure, reliable way to begin repository analysis workflows**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. CLI tool accepts Git repository URLs via command-line arguments with validation
2. Application initializes with proper logging, configuration loading, and error handling
3. Repository URL validation prevents malformed or potentially malicious inputs
4. CLI provides clear help documentation and usage instructions
5. Application exits gracefully with appropriate status codes for success/failure scenarios
6. Basic project structure established with Go modules and dependency management
7. Cross-platform builds supported for macOS, Linux, and Windows development environments

## Story 1.2: Secure Repository Ingestion

As a **security-conscious developer**,
I want **repositories to be cloned and isolated in secure sandbox environments**,
so that **untrusted code cannot access my system or network resources**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Git repositories cloned into isolated temporary directories with restricted permissions
2. Docker containers created with resource limits (2GB RAM, 4 CPU cores) and network isolation
3. Repository size validation prevents analysis of repositories exceeding 10GB limit
4. Clone operations timeout after reasonable duration to prevent hanging processes
5. Comprehensive audit logging captures all repository access and clone operations
6. Failed clone operations provide clear diagnostic information without exposing sensitive data
7. Automatic cleanup removes temporary files and containers after analysis completion or failure

## Story 1.3: Container Security Sandbox

As a **system administrator**,
I want **repository analysis to occur within secure container isolation**,
so that **potentially malicious code cannot compromise the host system or access external resources**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Docker containers launched with minimal base image and read-only file system mounts
2. Network access disabled except for essential Git operations during repository cloning
3. Container filesystem isolated from host with no shared volumes containing sensitive data
4. Resource monitoring prevents container processes from consuming excessive CPU or memory
5. Container execution time limits prevent indefinite running processes
6. Security scanning integration validates container images for known vulnerabilities
7. Container termination and cleanup handled gracefully even during unexpected failures

## Story 1.4: Basic Analysis Initialization

As a **developer**,
I want **the system to perform initial repository structure analysis and validation**,
so that **I can verify the repository is suitable for comprehensive analysis**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Repository structure scanning identifies primary programming languages and frameworks
2. File type analysis determines if repository contains supported JavaScript/TypeScript code
3. Project configuration detection identifies package.json, tsconfig.json, and other key files
4. Repository size and complexity metrics calculated for analysis feasibility assessment
5. Initial validation report generated with repository metadata and analysis readiness status
6. Unsupported or problematic repositories identified with clear feedback to user
7. Analysis preparation completes within 5 minutes for repositories up to 10GB size
