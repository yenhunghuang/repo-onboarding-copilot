    UpdateChecker   *UpdateChecker
}

func (d *DependencyAnalyzer) AnalyzeDependencies(packageJSON string) *DependencyReport
func (d *DependencyAnalyzer) CheckVulnerabilities(deps []Dependency) []Vulnerability
func (d *DependencyAnalyzer) GenerateDependencyGraph(deps []Dependency) *Graph
```

**Technology Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md#data-storage]:

-   **Vulnerability Data Sources**: NVD, OWASP, GitHub Advisory with daily automated feeds

        "transitive": ["object"], // Complete dependency tree
        "vulnerabilities": ["object"], // Security assessment results
        "licenses": ["object"] // License compatibility analysis
    }
}
```
