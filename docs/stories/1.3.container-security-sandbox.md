# Story 1.3: Container Security Sandbox

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** repository analysis to occur within secure container isolation,  
**so that** potentially malicious code cannot compromise the host system or access external resources.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Docker containers launched with minimal base image and read-only file system mounts
2. Network access disabled except for essential Git operations during repository cloning
3. Container filesystem isolated from host with no shared volumes containing sensitive data
4. Resource monitoring prevents container processes from consuming excessive CPU or memory
5. Container execution time limits prevent indefinite running processes
6. Security scanning integration validates container images for known vulnerabilities
