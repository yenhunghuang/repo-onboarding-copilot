# Epic 2: Core Analysis Engine

**Expanded Goal:** Implement the core JavaScript/TypeScript code analysis pipeline that transforms repository structure into comprehensive architectural understanding. This epic delivers the fundamental analysis capabilities including AST parsing, dependency tree generation, and component relationship mapping that enable automated codebase comprehension and form the foundation for all subsequent documentation generation.

## Story 2.1: JavaScript/TypeScript AST Parsing Engine

As a **developer analyzing an unknown codebase**,
I want **the system to parse and understand JavaScript and TypeScript source code structure**,
so that **I can get insights into functions, classes, modules, and code organization patterns**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. AST parsing engine processes JavaScript (.js, .jsx) and TypeScript (.ts, .tsx) files accurately
2. Code structure analysis identifies functions, classes, interfaces, variables, and export/import statements
3. Module relationship mapping tracks dependencies between source files and external packages
4. Syntax error handling provides graceful degradation for malformed or incomplete code files
5. Performance optimization enables parsing of repositories with 10,000+ source files within time limits
6. Memory management prevents parser from consuming excessive resources during large repository analysis
7. Parser output structured in standardized format suitable for downstream analysis and documentation generation

## Story 2.2: Dependency Tree Analysis and Vulnerability Scanning

As a **security-conscious developer**,
I want **comprehensive analysis of project dependencies with vulnerability assessment**,
so that **I understand the full dependency chain and can identify potential security risks**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Package.json and lock file parsing extracts complete dependency tree including transitive dependencies
2. Vulnerability database integration identifies known security issues in project dependencies
3. Dependency version analysis tracks outdated packages and suggests update recommendations
4. License compatibility checking identifies potential legal issues with dependency combinations
5. Dependency graph visualization data generated for interactive exploration of package relationships
6. Performance impact assessment estimates bundle size and load time implications of dependencies
7. Critical vulnerability detection triggers immediate alerts with severity scoring and remediation guidance

## Story 2.3: Architecture and Component Mapping

As a **software architect**,
I want **automated discovery and mapping of application architecture and component relationships**,
so that **I can quickly understand system structure and identify key integration points**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Component identification analyzes code patterns to identify React components, services, utilities, and configuration modules
2. Data flow analysis tracks state management patterns, API calls, and inter-component communication
3. Architecture pattern detection identifies common frameworks (React, Express, Next.js) and architectural styles
4. Integration point mapping discovers database connections, external API usage, and third-party service integrations
5. Cyclic dependency detection identifies problematic circular references and suggests refactoring opportunities
6. Component relationship graph generated with hierarchy, dependencies, and interaction patterns
7. Architecture summary report provides high-level system overview suitable for technical stakeholder communication

## Story 2.4: Code Quality and Complexity Analysis

As a **technical lead**,
I want **automated assessment of code quality, complexity, and maintainability metrics**,
so that **I can identify areas requiring attention and estimate maintenance effort**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Cyclomatic complexity calculation identifies overly complex functions and methods requiring refactoring
2. Code duplication detection finds repeated patterns and suggests consolidation opportunities
3. Technical debt scoring combines multiple metrics to prioritize improvement efforts
4. Code coverage analysis estimates testability and identifies untested code paths
5. Performance anti-pattern detection identifies common performance bottlenecks and inefficient code patterns
6. Maintainability index calculation provides quantitative assessment of code quality trends
7. Quality report generation provides actionable recommendations ranked by impact and effort required
